## Fuzzing

Fuzzing is a technique for sending arbitrary input into functions to see what happens. Typically this is done to weed out crashes/panics from software, or to detect bugs. In some cases all possible inputs are ran into the program (i.e. if a function accepts 16-bit integers it's trivial to try them all).

Moov runs Docker containers of several applications which execute [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) inside of them. This is designed to automate fuzzing and ensure higher quality software. Right now analysis of fuzz results is manual.

For example, if we're running fuzzing for `ach` the `Deployment` would be called `achfuzz`. We also run these fuzz containers as a low `PriorityClass` called `fuzz-low-priority` which pushes fuzzing cpu time down if production requests need more cpu or memory.

After you [setup `kubectl`](kubernetes.md) and authenticate [with Google's Cloud](google-cloud.md) you can download the fuzz data. You'll need to run `1-download.sh` located at [`cmd/cpfuzz/1-download.sh`](../cmd/cpfuzz/1-download.sh) from the root of the infra repository.

```

After downloading each `*.output` file contains the panic's trace and the other two files contain the input. Each crash should be verified correct with a test that passes in the respective project.

### Copying crasher files

We have a script (`./cmd/cpfuzz/2-copy-crashers-to-projects.sh`) that grabs the latest downloaded fuzz crashers and copies them to locally cloned moov-io projects. This script assumes a lot: that it is ran from moov-io/infra's root and that moov-io projects are on the same filesystem level as infra.

```
$ ./cmd/cpfuzz/2-copy-crashers-to-projects.sh

### Resetting fuzz pods

Often it's useful to reset the fuzz pods (delete any data) after copying down any crasher files. To do this run `./cmd/cpfuzz/3-roll-fuzz-pods.sh` which will delete the fuzz Kubernetes manifests and reapply them.

### Copying corpus files

You can download the corpus files (go-fuzz creates additional files as it runs) with `./cmd/cpfuzz/1-download.sh corpus`.
